  <div>
    <p>Missing data is a challenge every DS and AI/ML team encounters. It’s an inevitable part of working with real-world data—yet it often feels like a barrier to getting started on the 'real work'.</p>
<p>Under pressure from tight deadlines or stakeholder expectations, teams may resort to quick fixes, such as dropping missing values. But these shortcuts almost always backfire. Poorly handled missing data can distort predictions and lead to flawed inferences, yet its impact is often hidden—making it difficult to see just how much harm these rushed decisions cause.</p>
<p>When dealing with missing data there are two approaches that you can take:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Complete-Case (CC) Analysis:</strong> This method involves removing instances with missing values</li>
<li><strong>Imputation:</strong> This method fills in the missing values</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will demystify missing data theory, helping you understand its effects and the risks of CC analysis. By the end, you’ll be better equipped to make informed choices that preserve the integrity of your analyses.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-is-the-data-missing">
<h2>Why is the Data Missing?</h2>
<p>The first step in tackling missing data is understanding why it’s missing. Without this knowledge, any method applied to address it is more guesswork than science. Your missing data can fall into one of three mechanisms:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Missing Completely at Random <strong>(MCAR)</strong></li>
<li>Missing at Random <strong>(MAR)</strong></li>
<li>Missing Not at Random <strong>(MNAR)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To explain these mechanisms, consider a scenario involving student exam grades (<span class="math">\(y\)</span>) and class attendance (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>). Additionally, we will have a binary variable (<span class="math">\(m\)</span>) that indicates missingness, where <span class="math">\(m=1\)</span> means the grade is present, and <span class="math">\(m=0\)</span> means it is missing. The image below shows the simulated dataset that was created for this article.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<object data="../images/simulated_data_scatter.svg" style="width: 100%;" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mcar">
<h2>MCAR</h2>
<p>MCAR occurs when data is missing randomly, with no relationship to observed (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) or unobserved (<span class="math">\(y\)</span>) variables. The probability of missingness is constant accross all variables: <span class="math">\(\textrm{P}(m|y,x) = \textrm{P}(m)\)</span>. For example, a student missing an exam due to an injury is an instance of MCAR—it happens independently of their academic performance or other characteristics.</p>
<p>To illustrate how MCAR affects data, I simulated a scenario where each student's grade has a 30% probability of being missing (i.e., <span class="math">\(P(m)=0.30\)</span>). Below, you can see a comparison between the original grade distribution and the distribution after applying the MCAR mechanism and conducting a CC analysis:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<object data="../images/Grade_MCAR_distribution_plot.svg" style="width: 100%;" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</div>
<p>The grade distribution remains centered around the same region but has wider tails, indicating increased uncertainty. This uncertainty arises because fewer data points are available.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the original dataset contains 400 observations, but after applying CC analysis, only 200 remain. The variance is given by: <span class="math">\(\textrm{Var}(y) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n-1}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is the sum of squares and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. If <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> remains constant while <span class="math">\(n\)</span> decreases the variance increases.</p>
<p>Thus, when using CC analysis under an MCAR mechanism, you can expect more uncertain estimates due to the reduced sample size. However, they should remain unbiased.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mar">
<h2>MAR</h2>
<p>MAR occurs when missingness depends on observed variables (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) but not directly on the unobserved values (<span class="math">\(y\)</span>). For example, students with low attendance (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) may be more likely to skip exams. This relationship is expressed as: <span class="math">\(\textrm{P}(m | y,x) = \textrm{P}(m | x)\)</span></p>
<p>When data is MAR, CC analysis is unsuitable. Since missingness (<span class="math">\(m\)</span>) depends on an observed variable (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>), excluding missing cases can introduce bias, leading to invalid conclusions.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I simulated an MAR mechanism where students with lower attendance had a higher probability of missing grades. The figure below compares the original grade distribution with the distribution after applying the MAR mechanism and performing CC analysis:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<object data="../images/Grade_MCAR_and_MAR_distribution_plot.svg" style="width: 100%;" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</div>
<p>The resulting distribution shifts significantly, becoming more left-skewed and moving further away from the original data. This demonstrates how CC analysis under MAR can distort results, leading to unreliable conclusions.</p>
<p>Since missingness is related to observed values (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>), imputation methods are required to properly handle MAR data. These methods leverage the relationship between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to estimate missing values. A detailed discussion on imputation techniques will be covered in a future post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mnar">
<h2>MNAR</h2>
<p>MNAR is the most challenging type of missingness, occurring when missingness depends directly on the missing values themselves (<span class="math">\(y\)</span>). For example, students who anticipate poor grades because they didn't take time to prepare for the exam may choose to skip it, regardless of their attendance record. This relationship is expressed as: <span class="math">\(\textrm{P}(m | y,x) = \textrm{P}(m | y)\)</span></p>
<p>Unlike MCAR and MAR, handling MNAR data is particularly difficult because the missing values themselves influence the probability of missingness. This means standard imputation methods may not work effectively without making strong assumptions about the missing data mechanism.</p>
<p>While imputation is possible, it requires additional assumptions about the relationship between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and careful modeling of the missingness pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="determining-the-missingness-mechanisms">
<h2>Determining the Missingness Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Now that we've explored the different types of missing data mechanisms, lets focus on how to determine which one might be affecting your dataset. While no method is foolproof, the following four approaches can be used:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Plot the probability of missingness against a variable's range, such as attendance. The plot below illustrates simulated data where each value of <span class="math">\(y\)</span> has a 25% chance of being missing, with Attendance (<span class="math">\(x\)</span>) on the x-axis. Since the probability of missingness remains flat across different attendance levels, this suggests MCAR. Minor fluctuations at extreme values (e.g., 30% attendance) occur due to the rarity of these observations in the dataset. In contrast, if the probability of missingness increases or decreases systematically with <span class="math">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, the data is likely MAR or MNAR. Keep in mind you need a very large amount of data points to build reliable plots or create buckets for ranges of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure align-center">
<object data="../images/miss_probability_mcar_mar.svg" style="width: 100%;" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><strong>Statistical Tests:</strong> To complement visualizations, you can perform statistical tests like Little’s MCAR test, which uses a <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span> distribution to assess whether mechanism is MCAR. Additionally, the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test can evaluate whether elements of the sequence are mutually independent, helping to detect patterns (e.g., MAR) in the missingness mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="raw-html"><br /></span></p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Fit a predictive model, such as Logistic Regression, to estimate the probability of missingness (<span class="math">\(m=1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(m=0\)</span>). If no covariate other than the intercept (<span class="math">\(\beta_0\)</span>) has a statistically significant effect, the missingness pattern is likely MCAR. If the intercept is not statistically significant but another coefficient is—such as <span class="math">\(\beta_1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\beta_2\)</span> —the mechanism is MAR (for <span class="math">\(\beta_1\)</span>) or MNAR (for <span class="math">\(\beta_2\)</span>, which requires <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to be imputed first). Moreover, if both <span class="math">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta_2\)</span> are statistically significant then it's possible you have more than a single missing data mechanism in your data. This approach assumes a well-fitted model that satisfies the required assumptions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\textrm{logit} \left( \frac{P(m | x,y)}{1 - P(m | x,y)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><span class="raw-html"><br /></span></p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><strong>Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Involving individuals with in-depth knowledge of the data, processes, or context is invaluable when investigating the reasons behind missing data. Subject matter experts can offer insights or direct you toward likely causes of missingness. For instance, in the simulated student example, consulting teachers or the grade assignment committee—who may have encountered similar cases over the years—can help clarify why certain grades are missing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding and properly handling missing data is crucial for producing reliable analyses and predictions. Dropping rows through CC analysis can lead to increased uncertainty and biased results if the missingness mechanism is not MCAR.</p>
<p>In a future article we will explore multiple imputation—a personal favourite of mine—to effectively handle complex cases like MAR and MNAR.</p>
